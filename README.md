# Andrew Cookson

A junior developer that strives to create test driven projects under limited time restrains.

Previously a Technical Project Manager, who enjoys making problems as much as solving, so much so that I had to get more skilled in development.

Now I'm looking for a role which gives me the opportunity to continue progressing and growing at the incredibly rapid rate I have during my time with Makers Academy.

## Projects

[Email Dashboard](https://github.com/acookson91/email-dashboard) | Using a webhook, I created a email dashboard that broke down certain events. I concentrated on keeping the app quick by limiting calls to the model. Incorporating Sidekiq when receiving data meant the dashboard could handle high volumes of requests monitoring status.   | Backend: Ruby, Rails, SideKiq Postgres /w ActiveRecord | RSpec, Capybara, Protractor 
[Checkout with Custom Promotions](https://github.com/acookson91/checkout-with-promotions) | A checkout system that needs to allow custom promotions to be added by the marketing department. In this project I focused on object oriented design and flexibility, so new promotions can be added easierly. | Backend: Ruby | RSpec

Only once they have watched, or saved the video can they post there own back. | Backend: Ruby, Rails, Postgres /w ActiveRecord, Frontend: Angularjs, HTML5(Slim), CSS3| RSpec, Protractor, Karma
